[:attack {:name "Attack and Defense"
          :description "The attacker rolls a d20 “to hit” and adds any modifiers, including the +1 Attack Bonus. If the score is equal to or greater than the target's armor class (AC) the attack hits and the attacker rolls damage. A natural “1” on the die roll is always a failure. A natural “20” is always a hit, if the opponent can be hit at all (e.g., monsters that can only be hit by silver or magic weapons cannot be hit by normal weapons, so a natural “20” with a normal weapon will miss)."

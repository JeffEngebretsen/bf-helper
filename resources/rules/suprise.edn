[:suprise {:name "Check for Suprise"
           :description "If applicable, roll 1d6. Characters are usually surprised on a 1-2, or in the case of a well-prepared ambush on a 1-4. Deafened characters are surprised on a 1-3 and blinded characters on a 1-4. Elves are surprised on a 1 normally, 1-2 if deafened, and 1-3 when blinded or in ambushes. Characters who are surprised cannot act in the first combat round, though they can defend themselves and so have normal AC.
(At this point, the GM may also roll for the monster's reaction to the party. See the Core Rules for details.)"
